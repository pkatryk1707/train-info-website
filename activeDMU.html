		<p>Built by <strong>Hyundai Rotem</strong> and <strong>Tokyu</strong> between 2007 and 2012 to replace the decaying British Mk2 and Cravens coaches, they entered service that year and were deployed on intercity and some commuter services, and operate some Enterprise services to Belfast making them the backbone of all Irish rail services.</p>

		<p>Built by <strong>CAF</strong> between 2002 and 2005, you can mostly find these trains on Dublin area commuter services and sometimes the Enterprise if an ICR set is unavailable. They are due to be replaced by the 90000 class Dart+ units soon and will probably be cascaded to replace the aging 2600 DMUs in Cork.</p>

	<div class="side-text">
		<p>Built by <strong>Tokyu</strong> in 2000, these are primarily used on western railway corridor services out of Limerick, and occasionaly sub in for a 2600 for Cork commuter services if one is unavailable. The cab end gangways were recently removed as they were unused and the CCTV installed would stop it from being used anyway</p>
