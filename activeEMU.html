    <p>Built by Linke-Hoffman-Busch in 1983, they are 2 car units consisting of a power and trailer car, which are usually coupled together to form a 10 car train. They entered service in 1984 and have been in constant service, however the units were refurbished by Siemens in 2007 and 2008. They are soon to be replaced by the 90000 class.</p>
